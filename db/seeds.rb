# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
Category.create([
    { name: 'Looking for work' },
    { name: 'Looking for help' },  
    { name: 'Ofer work'},
    { name: 'Ofer help'},
    { name: 'Buy'},
    { name: 'Sell'},
]
    )
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
